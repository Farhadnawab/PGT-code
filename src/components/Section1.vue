              <p>
                These products protect your home from more than hurricane-force 
                damage, they also guard your family against would-be intruders. 
                The most common way to achieve impact resistance in windows 
                and doors is to select a product that uses laminated glass or 
                laminated insulating glass.</p>
              <p>
                Our impact-resistant laminated glass and laminated insulating 
                glass are designed to withstand repeated impact from a 
                nine-pound 2' x 4' beam traveling at 34 miles per hour. Even if the 
                glass is damaged, the interlayer will hold the glass pieces secure in 
                the frame and continue to keep unwanted elements outside.</p>
